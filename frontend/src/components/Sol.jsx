                        <h3>Physical Abuse:</h3>
                        <h4>Case:</h4>
                        <p className='case'> Physical abuse involves acts like hitting, slapping, or inflicting harm. This often results in visible injuries, but the emotional trauma can be just as damaging. The abuser may use force to control or punish the victim, leaving lasting physical and psychological scars.</p>
                        <h4>Preacution:</h4>
                        <p className='cau'> To prevent physical abuse, it's essential to encourage people to report early signs of violence and seek help. Communities can offer self-defense training and establish safe houses or shelters where victims can escape abusive environments.</p>

                        <h4>Case:</h4>
                        <p className='case'> Emotional abuse is characterized by constant belittling, verbal insults, threats, or manipulation designed to undermine the victim's self-esteem and mental health. This form of abuse can be as damaging as physical violence, though it often goes unnoticed since there are no visible signs</p>
                        <h4>Preacution:</h4>
                        <p className='cau'> Providing access to mental health support and therapy can help prevent emotional abuse. It's important to create awareness around emotional manipulation, offer family support systems, and provide platforms for victims to seek early intervention.</p>

                        <h3>Sexual Abuse:</h3>
                        <h4>Case:</h4>
                        <p className='case'> Sexual abuse occurs when someone is forced into non-consensual sexual acts, whether within an intimate relationship or not. This can include rape, unwanted touching, or being coerced into sexual activity against one's will.</p>
                        <h4>Precaution:</h4>
                        <p className='cau'> Education about the importance of consent is vital in preventing sexual abuse. Survivors should be encouraged to speak out, and confidential helplines and support services must be readily available. Legal protections and resources for counseling should also be ensured.</p>

                        <h4>Case:</h4>
                        <p className='case'>  Financial abuse involves controlling a person's access to their own money or resources, creating a financial dependency that traps the victim in the relationship. This often leads to long-term economic hardship and power imbalance</p>
                        <h4>Precaution:</h4>
                        <p className='cau'> To prevent financial abuse, individuals should be educated on financial independence and literacy. Encouraging separate financial accounts and promoting workshops that teach economic self-reliance can help reduce vulnerability.</p>

                        <p className='case'> Digital abuse refers to using technology to control, monitor, or harass someone. This could include spying on someone’s online activity, sending threatening messages, or controlling social media accounts.</p>
                        <h4>Precaution:</h4>
                        <p className='cau'> Teaching digital privacy and security is key to preventing digital abuse.

                        <p className='case'> Stalking is persistent, unwanted surveillance, following, or harassment, often instilling fear in the victim. Stalkers may follow victims physically or use technology to monitor them, creating a sense of helplessness.</p>
                        <h4>Precaution:</h4>
                        <p className='cau'> Installing security systems, advocating for legal measures like restraining orders, and creating awareness on how to deal with stalkers can help victims protect themselves. It’s also important to have community and law enforcement support.</p>

                        <p className='case'> Abusers often isolate their victims from family, friends, and community to make them dependent. Isolation limits the victim’s support system, making it harder for them to escape the abusive relationship.</p>
                        <h4>Precaution:</h4>
                        <p className='cau'> Encourage regular social interactions and ensure that people maintain connections with their support networks. Community centers can offer communication tools and spaces for individuals who might feel isolated.</p>
